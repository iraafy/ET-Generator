Conservative lawmakers and officials might breathe a sigh of relief if Boris Johnson resigns later this morning.

However, there are immediate concerns for those who desire the top job, before the leadership contest even kicks off.

Johnson will leave a badly divided party behind for whoever inherits the crown.

The Prime Minister himself -- his conduct, his judgment and whether or not he deserved his party’s support -- has been in itself one of the major dividing issues.

Then there are also the ideological divisions in the party, which have been exacerbated by years of arguments over Brexit and personal liberty during the pandemic.

Despite the Brexit vote taking place over six years ago, there are still major disagreements about what relationship should have with Europe, ranging from rejoining aspects of the EU to open hostility over international treaties.

Johnson’s successor will inherit this mess 12 years after the party took power in 2010. The country is facing a cost of living crisis and the party’s approval ratings have been tanking for months.

As attractive as it might sound to be Britain's leader (and there are plenty of people ready to throw their hats in the ring), it’s going to be hard to step out of the shadow of the most famous Prime Minister to take office since Winston Churchill.
